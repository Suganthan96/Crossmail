# Avail Nexus SDK - Developer Feedback - Bounty Report

*ETHGlobal Hackathon* 

---

##  Critical Errors

### 1. "ca not applicable" - TransferQuery.simulate Failure

Error: ca not applicable at TransferQuery.simulate

- *Impact:* Complete transaction blocker
- *Issue:* Cryptic error with no documentation on meaning or fix
- *Needed:* Error catalog explaining what "ca" means and troubleshooting steps

### 2. Insufficient Balance During Simulation

Simulation Error: Insufficient balance.

- *Impact:* Transactions fail despite verified adequate balance
- *Issue:* Unclear which balance is being checked (tokens? gas? which chain?)
- *Needed:* Documentation on balance requirements and what simulation checks

### 3. Generic Network Errors

Transaction failed to execute. This might be a temporary network issue.

- *Impact:* Poor UX, actual errors hidden
- *Needed:* Better error surfacing, retry logic, clear user guidance

##  Critical Documentation Gaps

### 1. Wallet Provider Integration
- Runtime errors with non-MetaMask wallets
- Missing: Required provider methods/properties
- Need: Integration guide with examples for Magic.link, WalletConnect, Privy

### 2. Version Migration
- Version 0.0.6 broke production with "Unsupported blockchain"
- Missing: Changelogs, breaking changes warnings
- Need: Migration guides and compatibility matrix

### 3. RPC Rate Limiting
- "Too Many Requests" blocks production use
- Missing: Rate limit documentation, API key instructions
- Need: Production deployment guide with retry logic

### 4. Simulation Phase
- No explanation of what simulation does or checks
- Missing: Complete simulation error reference
- Need: Troubleshooting guide for simulation failures

### 5. Testnet Setup
- No faucet links or token contract addresses
- Missing: Chain-specific setup instructions
- Need: Testnet guide with all required resources

---

##  Additional Gaps

- *Cross-chain patterns:* When to use bridge() vs execute() vs bridgeAndExecute()
- *Unified balance feature:* Exists but undocumented
- *Environment config:* Testnet vs mainnet safety checks
- *Intent Explorer:* Debugging tool not prominently featured
- *Error handling:* No best practices or examples

---

##  Top Recommendations

*Immediate:*
1. Document simulation errors (especially "ca not applicable")
2. Add actionable error messages with error codes
3. Create wallet integration guide
4. Document RPC limits with workarounds
5. Add testnet setup guide with faucets

*Long-term:*
- Implement structured error code system
- Add retry mechanisms to widget
- Create comprehensive API reference
- Build production deployment checklist
- Add more real-world examples

##  What Works Well

- Responsive Discord support team
- Quick bug identification and communication
- Solid core functionality when configured correctly
- Active community contributions

*Bottom line:* Great foundation, but documentation and error clarity need significant improvement.
